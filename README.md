# Customer Churn Analysis and Dashboard

This repository contains a detailed analysis of customer churn for a telecom company. The project aims to identify the factors contributing to customer churn and provide actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, especially in subscription-based industries. This project analyzes a dataset of customer information to uncover patterns and trends, offering data-driven strategies to reduce churn.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built using Power BI, the dashboard provides insights into:
  - Churn rate by contract type, payment methods, and demographics.
  - Average tenure and total charges for churned vs. retained customers.
  - Key services impacting churn rates.

- **Visualizations**:
  - Churn rate trends over years.
  - Service usage comparison for churned and retained customers.
  - Payment methods and their association with churn.

## Key Insights

1. **Churn by Contract Type**:
   - Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate (42.71%).
   - Two-year contracts have the lowest churn rate (2.85%).

2. **Churn by Payment Method**:
   - Electronic check users exhibit the highest churn.
   - Automatic payment methods correlate with lower churn rates.

3. **Impact of Services**:
   - Customers with multiple add-on services (e.g., online security, streaming) tend to have higher retention.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI**: For interactive and visually engaging dashboards.
- **Python**: Preprocessed data using pandas for cleaning and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Customer demographics.
- Contract details.
- Payment information.
- Usage statistics for telecom services.

(Note: Dataset is anonymized for privacy.)

## Future Enhancements

- Implement predictive modeling to forecast churn probability for individual customers.
- Deploy the dashboard as a web application using tools like Power BI Service or Streamlit.
- Integrate additional datasets for deeper analysis.
